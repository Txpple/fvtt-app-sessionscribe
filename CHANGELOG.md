# Changelog

What changed for a user of the tools and the skill, release by release. Dates are tag dates.

## Unreleased

- `.mcp.json.example` shows `FVTT_MCP_ENV`: a hosted world whose connection lives in its own fvtt-mcp-dnd5e env file needs it in the scribe's registration too, or molten reads fall back to `../fvtt-mcp-dnd5e/.env`.

## 1.2.1 — 2026-10-10 — the scribe may join as the bridge's Assistant GM user

- **The scribe may join as the `fvtt-mcp-dnd5e` bridge's own Assistant GM user**, and on the
  house worlds does (owner ruling, 2026-10-10, to stop user bloat): set `FOUNDRY_SCRIBE_USER` /
  `FOUNDRY_SCRIBE_PASSWORD` to the bridge's `FOUNDRY_USER` / `FOUNDRY_PASSWORD`. A separate
  Assistant GM user still works; both keys stay required. The "never the bridge's user" rule is
  gone from the docs and from the not-in-the-world message, whose fix now reads `set
  FOUNDRY_SCRIBE_USER to an existing Assistant GM (the bridge's user will do), or create it as
  one`. Why it is safe: Battle Flow's single-applier check (`game.users.activeGM?.isSelf`) is
  per user, so two clients on one user would both apply only while that user is the elected GM;
  Foundry elects the highest-role active GM, so with the DM connected as Gamemaster the
  Assistant GM is never elected, and the reader already refuses a read when its user is the
  elected GM while a combat runs. Verified on the sandbox: the scribe joined as the bridge's
  user while the bridge was connected, hung up, and the bridge stayed connected.
  `.env.example` now shows `Assistant DM` (the bridge's user) instead of `Scribe Assistant`.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-10-10 — npm run doctor and npm run install-skill

- **`npm run doctor`** checks the whole setup in one pass, one line per check (✓ works, ✗ blocks
  a session and says the fix, ! worth knowing), and exits non-zero on any ✗:
  `fvtt-mcp-dnd5e` built; its `.env` found (`FVTT_MCP_ENV` respected); `FOUNDRY_HOST`'s server
  up with a world running; a real, read-only join as `FOUNDRY_SCRIBE_USER` (through the same
  reader child every tool uses) with its role; `campaign.json` valid and naming the joined world;
  Edge; the skill link; and, as `!` only, the Python venv and ffmpeg. (#2)
- **`npm run install-skill`** links the `session-scribe` skill into `~/.claude/skills/` (a
  junction on Windows, a symlink elsewhere). Rerunning it is safe: a link already pointing here
  is kept, a stale one left by a moved clone is replaced, and a real folder there is never
  touched. It replaces the README's hand-typed `New-Item -ItemType Junction`. (#2)
- README: which tools need the transcription toolchain (only `transcribe-recording`) and which
  need Foundry, Edge or nothing, so a machine can be set up in stages. (#2)
- `npm ci` no longer warns about install scripts: `package.json`'s `allowScripts` approves
  esbuild's `postinstall`, which only checks the platform binary esbuild ships with. It is
  approved by name, not pinned to a version, since two copies are in the tree (this repo's
  build and vitest's vite) and they move with every dependency bump. (#2)

## 1.1.0 — 2026-10-10 — the server key is sessionscribe; setup fails fast

- **The server key is `sessionscribe`** (was `scribe`), the repo's name part, as
  `fvtt-mcp-imagegen` registers as `imagegen`. Tools now appear as `mcp__sessionscribe__*`; the
  tool names themselves (`scribe-status`, `fetch-recording`, ...) and the env names
  (`SCRIBE_CAMPAIGN_REPO`, `FOUNDRY_SCRIBE_USER`, ...) are unchanged. **Rename your
  registration:** `claude mcp remove -s user scribe`, then
  `claude mcp add -s user sessionscribe ...` (or rename the `scribe` key under `mcpServers` in
  `~/.claude.json`), and restart Claude Code. Anything that names `mcp__scribe__*` tools (a
  permission allowlist, a campaign repo's notes) needs the same edit. Log lines read
  `[sessionscribe]`.
- The description says what it is: an MCP server (it was "an app" since the `fvtt-app-*` days).
- **A `FOUNDRY_SCRIBE_USER` that is not in the world fails at the join** with the world's users
  and the fix (`FOUNDRY_SCRIBE_USER 'X' not found in world 'Y'; users: A, B, C — create it as an Assistant GM,
  or set FOUNDRY_SCRIBE_USER to an existing one (never the bridge's user)`), instead of the
  client's generic join error.
- **`npm run build` checks `fvtt-mcp-dnd5e` is built first** (its `dist/` is the Foundry client)
  and says so in one line, instead of a wall of tsc errors.
- At start the server logs whether `SCRIBE_CAMPAIGN_REPO/campaign.json` exists (a warning, never
  an exit).
- Setup docs: `.env.example` says up top that the Foundry connection is
  `../fvtt-mcp-dnd5e/.env` and lists the keys read from it; `.mcp.json.example` uses the full
  `node.exe` path and names `FOUNDRY_HOST=local` beside `molten`; the README gives the
  `~/.claude.json` entry for installs without `claude` on PATH.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-09-30 — the scribe, proven on a full campaign

The first release. Everything below landed between 2026-09-23 and 2026-09-26 and was proven
on the Greenrest campaign's last two sessions: session 8 replayed end to end from its Craig
link into a scratch clone (2026-09-24), and session 9, the finale, processed for real
(2026-09-29).

**The app** (broken out of `fvtt-mcp-dnd5e` by the owner's ruling of 2026-09-23, reversing
that repo's 3.0 decisions #16 and #17; the MCP retired its copies in its 4.0.0):
- Eight tools, driven by Claude Code through the `scribe` MCP server:
  - `scribe-status`: health, the record's completeness against `campaign.json`, and following a
    detached job.
  - `fetch-recording`: the Craig recording from its link (cook, download, extract) or from the
    DM's own zip, speakers mapped by Discord id. A detached job; the Craig key is never
    persisted.
  - `transcribe-recording`: faster-whisper on CUDA, the one Python step, resumable.
  - `build-transcript`: the retired `session_scribe.py align` ported line for line, with the
    whisper fix and `transcript-public.md` (the spoiler-free transcript the recap is written
    from). Parity on the 9 real sessions.
  - `export-session-chat`: the night's chat log into `chatlog.json`, visibility spelled out.
    Parity with the MCP's `export-chat-log`.
  - `analyze-combat`: the MCP's `get-combat-stats` ported verbatim and scoped to the session's
    window, then extended: Battle Flow's 2026-09 stamp families (reminders, chips, wards,
    maneuvers, clock riders, emanations), an arithmetic "traits denied" meter, and the fighting
    styles tallied per attacker. Parity with the MCP on 10/10 windows before it evolved.
  - `snapshot-party`: the party's sheets at the wrap, byte-compatible with `manage-actors
    export`, with digests of limited-use features and active effects.
  - `render-pdf`: the session's PDFs printed with headless Edge from their print sources, page
    counts checked, and every page rasterised to `audio/previews/` for review.
- **The Foundry reader** joins as the scribe's own **Scribe Assistant** user, injects its own
  page bundle, and never writes the world. It refuses another world, a login below Assistant
  GM, or being the elected GM while a combat runs. Every read runs in a one-shot child with a
  watchdog. `scripts/verify-reader.mjs` proves it leaves no trace.
- **Long steps are detached jobs** with their own logs under `<session>/audio/.jobs/`.
- **The `session-scribe` skill**, rewritten to these tools, with the recap, combat-log and
  GM-notes templates. Print keeps use `display: flow-root`, the only keep Chromium honours.
- **The record** is written to the campaign repo (`sessions/YYYY-MM-DD/`, `party-snapshots/`),
  per `fvtt-mcp-dnd5e`'s campaign-repo contract. No campaign fact lives in this repo.

**Verified** (2026-09-30): biome · `tsc --noEmit` · vitest 21 files, 128 tests · build · knip.
Live on the sandbox (2026-09-23): reader 4/4, parity 10/10 combat windows, 10/10 chat windows,
4/4 party snapshots byte-identical.
